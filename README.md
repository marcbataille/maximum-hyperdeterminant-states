# maximum-hyperdeterminant-states
This Python module is related to quantum circuits producing four-qubit maximum hyperdeterminant states.
The module provides functions to prove some assertions and numerical identities of the article "Quantum circuits generating four-qubit maximally entangled states" available on arXiv.
It contains also the implementation of the optimization algorithms used to find out some of the results of the paper. 

Usage  :

1) run the Python interpreter : ~$ python3

2) import the module : >>> from maxHD import *

3) use the functions of the module as needed
